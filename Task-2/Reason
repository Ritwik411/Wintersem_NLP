Many of Trump's remarks were controversial and helped his campaign garner extensive coverage by the mainstream media, trending topics,
and social media.Trump's campaign rallies attracted large crowds, as well as public controversy. Some of the events were marked by 
incidents of violence between Trump supporters and protesters, mistreatment of some journalists, and disruption by a large group of 
protesters who effectively shut down a major rally in Chicago. Trump himself was accused[21] of inciting violence at his rallies.
Trump's disdain for political correctness was a staple theme of his campaign and proved popular among his supporters. Many, including 
some mainstream commentators and some prominent Republicans, viewed him as appealing to racism, a charge that Trump has repeatedly denied.
Trump's most polarizing and widely reported proposals were about issues of immigration and border security, especially his proposed 
deportation of all illegal immigrants, the proposed construction of a substantial wall on the Mexicoâ€“United States border at Mexican 
expense, his characterizations of many illegal Mexican immigrants as "criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc", and a temporary ban on 
foreign Muslims entering the U.S.
